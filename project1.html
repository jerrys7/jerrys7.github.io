<h1>Images of the Russian Empire: Colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii Photo Collection</h1>
<!-- 	<h2><a href="coursework.html">Coursework</a> | <a href="research.html">Research</a> | <a href="projects.html">Projects</a></h2> -->
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this project is to digitize and colorize the Prokudin-Gorskii Photo Collection. Sergey Prokudin-Gorksy was a 20th century photographer who attempted to capture the Russian Empire in color. He employed a principle of three colors where Prokudin-Gorsky divided the visible spectrum into three colors by capturing the information in three black and white photos, through a red filter, a green filter and a blue filter. These photos are then proejcted together and stacked together to create beautiful color photos. </p>
<h2>The Algorithm </h2>
<p> The core algorithm used here to align the projected images together was to build an image pyramid that consisted of scaling the image by a certain factor and then recursively determinign the best displacement in both the x and y direction. We then scale this displacement accordingly as we scale back up the size of the image to get our original image.</p>
